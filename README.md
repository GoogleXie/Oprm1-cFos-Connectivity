-avgMetaSummarywithlabel.csv contains summarized FOS count for each OPRM1 A112G mouse brain (AA/GG) regions (Saline, Acute, Chronic), please see the morphine administration paradigm in the paper. 
-Bad Image.csv contains bad slices (region damaged, abnormal photo bleach on such slices) that are excluded in generating summarized FOS Counts.
